Incorporated fixes for protection issues from the CRAN version (thanks!). I'll be looking for a new maintainer, but I'd like to see the most changes on CRAN.

## Test environments

* Travis CI, Ubuntu 14.04, R 3.4.3
* win-builder (release and devel)

## R CMD check results

OK

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on all downstream dependencies. The check results were identical to those for the current CRAN version.
