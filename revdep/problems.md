    TeX was unable to calculate metrics for:
    
    	\char77
    
    Run the following commands for diagnosis:
    
    	tikzTest()
    	tikzTest("\\char77")
    
    Common reasons for failure include:
      * The string contains a character which is special to LaTeX unless
        escaped properly, such as % or $.
      * The string makes use of LaTeX commands provided by a package and
        the tikzDevice was not told to load the package.
    
    The TeX and log files used for the calculation can help diagnose the
    problem. If these files are missing, rerun the plot and make sure to
    keep the R session open.
